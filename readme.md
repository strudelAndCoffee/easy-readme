## Description

Easy Readme is an easy to use application to quickly generate a README file for your repository. Simply answer a few questions, and the Markdown will be coded with the information you provide, complete with table of contents, badges, and license (including a link to the license documentation.)

The layout of this README was generated using the application! (Images and video link added afterwards)

From the root directory in Git Bash/Terminal, type "node index.js" to run the program. A series of questions will collect the information you wish to include about your project, and will code the Markdown automatically.
